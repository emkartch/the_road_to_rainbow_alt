9/26 - Find background assets and appropriate tilemap then resize them - 30 minutes

9/28 - Create my own objects for the tileset - 30 minutes

9/28 - Create specific collisions for tile map - 30 minutes

9/28 - Sketch then layout tilemap - 60 minutes

*New Bug*: Despite trying multiple layering methods, I can't get the levers to show on top of the player when the player is behind it

9/28 - Get tilemap to change with interactive lever - 150 minutes

9/29 - Place all mobs wanted throughout the map - 45 minutes

*New Bug*: I tried to make it so the mobs will only start moving towards the player when they were visible on screen, but it wouldn't work

*New Bug*: Game only ends if all mobs are killed, so not killing smaller mobs then going to the boss area will cause a soft lock

9/29 - Play through and fix any small collision issues - 30 minutes

*New Bug*: If you win, the message timer bugs and won't time out and reset play and I can't figure out why
